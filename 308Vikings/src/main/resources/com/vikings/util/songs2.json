Just playin'\nJust me, new phone, new hair, new era\nI'm in the penthouse, baby\nHandpicked from bad apples and bad eggs\nHeld back, I had to grab crab legs\nAnd then there were only but a few\nConversations held with patience, what a party, what a view\nWhat a dress, what a song\nWhat a beautiful time\nMy folks downstairs still waitin' in line\nThey never been in these rooms\nNever stayed with these folks\nNever laughed at the news, never hated these jokes\nSo as I fly in my suit, in a group, undercover\nForcin' a new smile, he tells me another\nHe said \"What happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?\"\nThen he pushed me off the top and said \"Jump, nigga, jump!\"\n\n[Bridge: John Legend]\nOh don\u2019t bring me down I need a room up in the clouds\nI wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate\nOh my favorite mix, a little ignorance and bliss\nIn the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse\n\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nGo to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nGo to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nLet's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for\nWe'll tear down those penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nThose penthouse doors\nWe'll tear down the penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nBaby, I'm in the penthouse floor\nBaby, let's ride the elevator\nTil we can rise some more\nGo to the penthouse floor, penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)\n\n",

There's a small crash outside\n\nYelling\n\nVOICE: FREEZE!\n\nGUNSHOTS\n\nThe Boy and Dude 2 look at each other\n\nThe Boy begins to sprint towards the pool. Dude 2 doesn\u2019t notice at first as he is attentive to the outdoor struggle. As The Boy makes it outside, and is hastily getting closer to the pool, Dude 2 realizes what happened and raises his gun. He fires. The bullet skims by The Boy while he dives into the water. As he embraces the refreshing pool of ecstasy, Dude 1 falls through a door, distracting Dude 2\n\nAs The Boy approaches his drowning demise, feelings greet him. A wave of Euphoria is present but, it isn\u2019t the primary aspect of these feelings. At first, safety embraced The Boy as he escaped the empty web he was in. Then, just as suddenly, death demonstrated its dominance to The Boy as the feeling of safety mutated into something The Boy once heard, \u201cMore than likely we all just do this all again.\u00a0It's all a cycle.\u201d ...It echoed in The Boy\u2019s lost mind as death claimed him....\n\n\n...Silence...\n\n\n...The domed lights that line the center of the aisle blind The Boy as he wakes up on a bus coming back from camp. The bus isn\u2019t moving anymore. It\u2019s parked in the parking lot of a Methodist church. It\u2019s half empty. The Boy has this indescribable, vaguely familiar, but also fresh and organic feeling, for an unapparent reason but, The Boy dismisses it. As he swings his legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus, The Boy faces the phrase \u201cRoscoe\u2019s Wetsuit\" carved into the seat that was now in front of him, which he also dismisses...\n\n*******[PLAY SONG \"LIFE: THE BIGGEST TROLL\" AT THIS POINT]*******\n\n",

It\u2019s just the brand new kind of me\nNever bad, I found a brand new kind of free\n\n[Chorus]\nIt took a long, long road to get here\nIt took a brave, brave girl to try\nIt took one too many excuses, one too many lies\nDon't be surprised, don't be surprised\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf I talk a little louder, if I speak up when you're wrong\nIf I walk a little taller, I been under you too long\nIf you notice that I'm different, don't take it personally\nDon't be mad, it's just a brand new kind of me\n\n[Chorus]\nIt took a long, long road to get here\nIt took a brave, brave girl to try\nI've taken one too many excuses, one too many lies\nDon't be surprised, see you look surprised\n\n[Bridge]\nIf you were a friend, you wanna get to know me again\nIf your were worth a while you would be happy to see me smile\nI'm not expecting sorry, I'm too busy finding myself\nI've got this, I've found me, I've found me\n\n[Verse 4]\nI don\u2019t need your opinion, I\u2019m not waiting for your okay\nI\u2019ll never be perfect, but at least now I\u2019m brave\nNow my heart is open, and I can finally breathe\nDon\u2019t be mad, it\u2019s just a brand new kind of free\nThat ain't bad, it\u2019s just a brand new kind of me\nDon't be mad, its just a brand new time for me\n\n",

(what?)\nCreepin' up in the shower on bitches like Anthony Perkins (ha)\nDefari\nLurkin' in the ranks\nI'm tryin' to be like that brother Ant and stack mad Banks\nPlus give thanks and praise\nFor each day I'm able to raise\nAnd see that foggy haze\nComin' off the coast of the Pacific\nWe stretch to the Atlantic my crew is Likwit\n\nHook\n\nVerse 3:\nYo fuck the pennies give me the silver dollars\nThe smooth scholar working hard straight blue collar\nAppreciate wealth so I do for myself\nFirst collaborate with live niggas and divide the purse\nThe well rehearsed MC\nDefari Heru\nI crack the glass blackboard MCs so I can see through I do my Dew\nDo my thang\nHip hop is my Love Supreme\nThat's word to John Coletrane\nThis cat Dwayne\nRollin' down the diamond lane\nTravel by train, bus, boat, car or airplane\nTo different venues with our names on the fliers\nLikwit niggas known to get ship poppin' and get it on fire\nI'm Extra Swift like my man Eric Brooks\nI keep an eye out for crooks\nWho contemplate rapin' my notebooks\nSome cut fast but they don't' cut faster\nThen the Kutmaster Kurt\nWhen I work\nI'm climbin' ladders\n\nHook\n\n",
