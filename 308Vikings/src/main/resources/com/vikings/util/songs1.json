I got no\nSex on my feet\nSex in my drawer\nSex in my shoes\nOr sex on the floor, I said\n\n[Chorus]\n\n",

Am I waiting to break?\nWhen I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape\nOh I'm wishin' I had what I'm takin' for granted\n\n[Refrain]\nI can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong\nOh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck\nOver and over and over again\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done\nFrom the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun\nAnd then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved\nOh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved\n\n[Bridge]\nIn the mean time, we let it go\nAt the road sign we used to know\nWe can let this drift away\nOh we let this drift away\nAt the bay side, we used to shore\nIn the moonlight, we let it go\nWe can let this drift away\nOh we let this drift away\nCause you've always got to change your mind\nCause you've always got to change your mind\nOh love, can you hear me?\nOh let it drift away\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done\nFrom the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun\nAnd then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved\nOh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved\n\n[Bridge]\nIn the mean time, we let it go\nAt the road sign we used to know\nWe can let this drift away\nOh we let this drift away\nAt the bay side, we used to shore\nIn the moonlight, we let it go\nWe can let this drift away\nOh we let this drift away\nCause you've always got to change your mind\nCause you've always got to change your mind\nOh love, can you hear me?\nOh let it drift away\n\n",

That means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me\nI mean, I don't wanna say it in person, I just bury my head in your armpit which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth\nLike, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do\nAnd remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...\nWell, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world\nYou know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to someone giving a fuck\nI'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit\nI mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo\n\n[Chorus 3]\nFuck me so you'll stop baby talking\nFuck me so you'll stop baby talking\nFuck me so you'll stop baby talking\nLove me so you stop baby talking\nI don't really wanna let go of you\nI heard I change my mind way too often\nYour baby talk is creeping me out\nFuck me so you'll stop baby talking\n\n",

And see me missing you?\nOooh, I miss you, I miss you, miss me!\nMiss me! I miss you. Miss me!\n\n",

What have I done? What have I done?\nOh, what have I done? I don't even know my last name\nWhen it turned in, \"Oh no, what have I done?\"\nAnd I don't even know my last name\nIt started off, \"Hey cutie, where are you from?\"\nAnd then it turned in, \"Oh no, what have I done?\"\nAnd I don't even know my last name, oh yeah\n---\n\n",
