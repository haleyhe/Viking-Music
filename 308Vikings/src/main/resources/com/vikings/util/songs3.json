You want me to listen to you baby?\nAw, is that what you want from me?\nHah, you better get that backdoor, go on\nHell no (Told Ya)\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nYou don't hear me out here knocking?\nThat mean don't come...You want me to leave right now? The closure start today?\nIt's good, I can still come back and wash your car if you need me to\nFor that breakfast and that guave sweetener, I, no more of that?\nAnd the waffle gone too? I'll come inside so I can hear you. No?\nOkay, alright, okay, I'll call you...don't call you, call you, no, don't call you, okay\nOne more thing, you calling the cops?\nI'mma leave\n\n",

No, bed no\nRollin' with the punk rockers, I ain't lyin'\nFake guns, fake bands, fake punk, I ain't buyin'\nHit the road, all I know, rock and roll ain't dyin'\nAbout fifteen deep we hit the streets low ridin'\nBy the time we made it to New Orleans\nIt must have been half past three\nBy the time we made it to Memphis we were crazy\nTonight, you are our blanket and you're gonna keep us warm\nTonight, protect us from the storm\nHe was back, causin' troubled time's they're a comin' 'round\nOh no, let me go to another round\nTuesday night is when the storm's gonna settle down\nHad a glance, circumstance, don't cause, trouble bound\nShe's the one, all alone, I come lookin'\nSmoke and mirrors as I watch, aw, that girl was trippin'\nIt's no fun, lost again, to have your heart broken\nGreed is from a world that is built on hustlin'\nBy the time we made it to New Orleans\nIt must have been half past three\nBy the time we made it to Memphis we were crazy\nTonight, you are our blanket and you're gonna keep us warm\nTonight, protect us from the storm\nThe breaks were fallin' when they had failed\nEvery road can lead ya straight down to fuckin' hell\nRain stopped fallin' when they had failed\nYeah, every road can take ya straight down to hell\nDoin' nothin' here, everyone straight trippin'\nHappy at times, are gone, past starts slippin'\nThis will be enough to keep me on the road livin'\nGood every night, in a different city I'll be sleepin'\nLet me know, here we go, met a girl named Lola\nIs she here? Is she there? Drinkin' Jack and Cola\nShe says, \"Tim, where ya been? I got somethin' to show ya\"\nLola fired off her clothes and started rock and rollin'\nBy the time we made it to New Orleans\nIt must have been half past three\nBy the time we made it to Memphis we were crazy\nTonight, you are our blanket and you're gonna keep us warm\nTonight, protect us from the storm\n\n",

From the top!\nAlright, okay\nThis is how we talk shit for 8 bars at the beginning\nMy team always winning\nIn the front row, grinning\n\n[Verse 1: Blueprint]\nWe breathe adrenaline and exhale acid rain\nPlay with broken glass, shake off the pain\nWe roll on you fast, take off your gold chain\nWe take, all the cash, we take, all the blame\nWe move, all the merch, CDs, and shirts\nFor you, this is a game, but for me this is work\nI clock in\nSoon as I step on the stage\nI get paid when my record is played\nThe 'Final Frontier'\nIs when you master the stereo mix and twing\nSnares and kicks like hands and fists\nSo when you know, let the next man diss\nBut act like you don't care one bit (ha!)\nSee 'em around, give 'em a pound\nAnd when his hand extend, you crack a smile\nAnd punch him dead in his shit, see, ha\nSoul Position in, sole possession of, pole position\nHold your breath and listen\n\n[Hook: Blueprint]\nWe're here!\nThe final frontier!\n\n[Verse 2: Vast Aire]\nWe're here now niggas..\nMan, damn these hoes\nSmack a herb in his face and strike a b-boy pose\nWith a little alligator shirt, don't make me\nSpit a verse with the subs all bassy\nI been doing this since 10 years old\nAnd ever since then they wouldn't leave me alone\nYou know Ox is so far you can't see the throne\nYou're lucky, if you peep my ankle\nYour girl's hands, she's grabbing her ankles\nWorking my box spring and singing the Star Spangled\nBitch I ain't a patriot! I'm more like a jet type\nThat'll hit you with a lead pipe, if the stats don't land right\nNiggas try to kill me but I caught the kite\n(That's why) They say \"they're here\" like Poltergeist\nWe're here niggas!\n\n[Hook: Blueprint]\nWe're here! (Hey Rambo, get outta bed.. go to school..)\nThe final frontier! (Alright.. set it..)\n\n[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]\nWe breathe adrenaline, Rambo crime Mega Man dust\nFuck computer, I'm 21-bazooka tooth salute\n'Plan 9 from Outer-', with a BK-wild hooker out the silo\nYou can file the 'Frontier' under 'Final'\nVinyl-killer fame, zig-zag brain companion\nTested positive for riot mouth and pled 5 on the damage\nWith a curfew in the city (right?)\nLiberty and justice\nPlus Timmy's stuck in a ditch without his dog for once\n[Park?] blood in a sink, and then my lung out of a fiery speaker\nI like how the emphysema leaks over your [liters? leaders?]\nGatekeeper, [pleats?], receivers, & bum aqualung\nWhere vertebraes are optional, personally I rock one\nPersonally, I'm Loch Ness; breakwater prickly spine, and bad options\n[Riddle Aes' Rizzle a similar bad doctors?]\nBlastoff geyser, back to the crafting and the last lost [fiber?]\n\n[Hook: Blueprint]\nWe're here! (..bitch.)\nThe final frontier!\n\n[Verse 4: Murs]\nFirst time I grabbed the pen, [the guess is the beginning zen?]\nIt's in stores now motherfucker, pick it up!\nBraces still flipping up like Pac rolling his grave\nEver since he left these pseudo-thugs can't behave\nThey use his name to support frail frames\nIf it wasn't for them bodyguards your ass would get maimed\nI don't play the strap game\nI play that bring the bullshit to wax and get slapped game\nSo fuck a fat chain\nI'm bumpin' Bad Brains, or something that strange\nWhile playin' Max Payne - my hood plays the crack game\nI'm just a ghetto geek, blessed with the gift of speech\nSo I can quote Howard Zinn, put a fist to your cheek\nHit rock bottom, french kiss the feet\nAnd make victory my bitch by the end of the week and...\n\n[Hook & outro: Blueprint]\nWe're here!\nThe final frontier!\n\nWe're here!\n\nThe final frontier\nStop talking shit\nLearn how to rap first\nThe basics\nFundamentals\nDef Jux\nPrintmatic\nRhymesayers\nWeightless\nYo, Soul Position\nRjd2 on the tracks..\nWith his happy ass..\nPeace to Ramble Krohn..\n\n",

In desperate need of someone\nBuilding up mental sufferation\nAsking for deliverance of just one girl\nOne to come cross my path and proceed on my road\n\nDark angel\nDescending from the sky\n\nCome to darken I night\nShe wiped away the years I cried\nWhich way does this angel...\n\nSaid I have her, said I had her\nSaid I want her, just don't need her\nWhen you receive what you crave, you still won't be satisfied\nThe questions still roll in my mind\nYet I wouldn't leave her for false assumption\nDon't want the company of depression\nShe's the one who answered the call\nLift I to my feet when my knees gave to the fall\nAnd it was just one girl\nIt was just one girl\nTo hear I, hear I call\n\n",

pop the tags, I don't want 'em\nAnd my niggas they been placed the vote\nBut you needed to get off the boat\nI can't blame it on me I said \"No\"\nGot her head so big it explode\n\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nYou said you gon' fuck me to death when you see me\nYou said that, you said that\nYou said you gon' do me the worst, I remember you right when you said that\nYou said you gon' kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts\nWe talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up\nI lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears\nI bite on her butt and I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here\nShe look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life like I'm Dr. Phil\nLet's get freaky deeky 'round here\n\n[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)\nSay now (say now), ooh, ooh, ooh\n\n[Verse 3: Young Thug]\nLet's make our last toast, she gets the last gulp\nI got some Actavis yeah, I want the last dose\nI got a good cash flow, but I don't want the fast dough\nYoung Thugger got filthy rich, I came right out the rat-hole (facts)\nI smoked a whole leaf, I'm drinking codeine\nI want some head and knees, I don't want no teeth\nI should've called off, I'm bout to OD\nIn her mouth like a golf ball, my two homies\nLay it up on me, I make her squirt on the couch, eww\nPrivate party, only broads here\nWe pass forty caps, no beers (got the forty capsule)\nEvery diamond on me crystal clear\nMolly on me, baby, take it off of me (off of me)\nCAT scan, white stuff on my jeans (lap dance)\nHit it from the back, loosen up her spleen\nSay you mine, I'ma take it off and raw dog\n\n[Chorus 2: Young Thug]\nYou said you gon' fuck me to death when you see me\nYou said that, you said that\nYou said you gon' do me the worst, I remember you right when you said that\nYou said you gon' kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts\nWe talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up\nI lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears\nI bite on her butt and I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here\nShe look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life like I'm Dr. Phil\nLet's get freaky deaky around here\n\n[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]\nSay now, ooh,
