Vikings Music project is a a web-based music streaming platform that I co-created for for my semester long Senior Design course. For this project, my team of four reverse-engineered Spotify and created over 50 use cases that we later turned into UML class and sequence diagrams as a basis for our project design. We used the Java Spring framework with an MySQL database to implement the backend and used AngularJS, jQuery, HTML, and CSS for the user interface. This project has broaden my understand of various web technologies and the importance of writing easily maintainable code.
